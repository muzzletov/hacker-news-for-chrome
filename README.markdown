## Hacker News Chrome Extension  

This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from Y Combinator's [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). 
It was originally developed by Adam Albrecht.
But looking at the source I felt the urge to clean it up to a large degree.
Also, I remove search, which I wasn't using anyways.
There is a saving function now, that can be issued by holding CTRL while clicking on a title.
